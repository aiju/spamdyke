Most of the time, upgrading between versions of spamdyke is as simple as
replacing the old binary with the new one.  However, sometimes changes are
introduced that aren't backwards-compatible.  Every time this is done, a
major version number change will occur (e.g. 1.x.x to 2.0.0).

In each version, the README.html file will reflect the currently available
options and features.  Be sure to check that file for full details on these
changes.

UPGRADING FROM VERSION 2.x.x to 3.0.0:
  Short command line options (single letter options) no longer work as before:
  1) They cannot be clustered.  For example, "-rlRc" is no longer valid.
     Each option must be separate.  For example, "-r -l -R -c".
  2) Short options can now take optional values.  (In version 3.0.0, the only
     such option is "-l".)  Values given to these options must not be separated
     by a space.  For example, "-l3" is valid.

  The long command line option "use-syslog" has been changed to "log-level" and
  now takes an optional numeric value.

  The format of the syslog entries has changed for delivered messages.  The
  keyword "origin:" has changed to "origin_ip:".  The new keywords
  "origin_rdns:" has been inserted before the remote server's rDNS name and
  the new keyword "auth:" has been inserted before the authenticated user's
  username.  If the entry shows a timeout, the new keyword "reason:" will be
  inserted before the real reason for the rejection (if there was one).
  Any scripts written to analyze the logs will need to be updated.
