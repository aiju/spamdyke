================================================================================
=== UPGRADING FROM VERSION 4.x TO 5.0.0
================================================================================
In addition to changing the naming of some options, spamdyke 5.0.0 treats some
concepts differently than previous versions.  Because of these changes, it is
not possible to configure spamdyke 5.0.0 to get exactly the same behavior as
version 4.3.1.

Most significantly, spamdyke 5.0.0 no longer allows whitelisted connections to
relay.  Whitelisting only allows a connection to bypass spamdyke's filters.
In version 5.0.0, a connection is allowed to relay if:
  - The RELAYCLIENT environment variable is set before spamdyke starts.  This
    is typically done by the tcpserver process when the IP address matches an
    entry in /etc/tcp.smtp
  - The client authenticates.  Authenticated connections are always allowed
    to relay.
  - The client's IP address matches a value given with the "ip-relay-entry"
    or "ip-relay-file" options.
  - The client's rDNS name matches a value given with the "rdns-relay-entry" or
    "rdns-relay-file" options.

Another change affects the way spamdyke's sender MX filter works.  In version
5.0.0, spamdyke will give preference to an MX record over an A record.  For
example, suppose a sender's domain had an A record with a valid IP address and
an MX record with a name that did not resolve.  Previous versions of spamdyke
would allow the connection because of the A record.  Version 5.0.0 will ignore
the A record because the MX record exists.  If the MX record does not resolve,
the sender MX filter will not allow the connection.  Realistically, this change
will only affect a very few senders.

The remaining backwards-incompatible changes are existing options with new
names.  Edit spamdyke's configuration file or command line:
  If the "reject-missing-sender-mx" option is given, it should be changed to
  "reject-sender" with a value of "no-mx".

  If the "rejection-text-missing-sender-mx" option is given, it should be
  renamed to "rejection-text-sender-no-mx".

  If the "reject-identical-sender-recipient" option is given, it should be
  changed to "reject-recipient" with a value of "same-as-sender".

  If the "rejection-text-identical-sender-recipient" option is given, it should
  be renamed to "rejection-text-recipient-same-as-sender".

  If the option "local-domains-file" is given, it should be renamed to
  "qmail-rcpthosts-file".

  If the option "local-domains-entry" is given, it should be removed.  Any
  domains given with this option should be added to the file given with
  "qmail-rcpthosts-file".

  If qmail's "morercpthosts" file is provided to spamdyke with the
  "qmail-rcpthosts-file" option (formerly "lcoal-domains-file"), the CDB file
  should be provided instead with the "qmail-morercpthosts-cdb" option.

That's it!



================================================================================
=== NEW OPTIONS
================================================================================
The following options have been added to spamdyke:
  ip-relay-entry: Gives individual IP addresses that are allowed to relay.
  ip-relay-file: Gives a filename containing IP addresses that are allowed to
    relay.
  rdns-relay-entry: Gives individual rDNS names that are allowed to relay.
  rdns-relay-file: Gives a filename containing rDNS names that are allowed to
    relay.
  more-help: Shows the full list of available options with descriptions.
  recipient-validation-command: Sets the full path to the spamdyke-qrv binary
    that is to be used during recipient validation.
  reject-recipient: Takes multiple values to filter recipients, including the
    ability to reject invalid recipients!
  reject-sender: Takes multiple values to filter senders, including the ability
    to reject senders with different addresses than the username used during
    authentication.
  rejection-text-sender-not-local: Allows setting the rejection text sent when
    the sender address is not hosted on the local server.
  rejection-text-sender-authentication-mismatch: Allows setting the rejection
    text sent when the sender address does not match the username given during
    authentication.
  rejection-text-recipient-invalid: Allows setting the rejection text sent when
    the recipient address does not exist.
  rejection-text-recipient-unavailable: Allows setting the rejection text sent
    when the recipient address temporarily cannot receive mail (usually due to
    a file permission problem).

A new program is also included: spamdyke-qrv
This program should be compiled and installed as a "setuid root" binary if
recipient validation is needed (see the "reject-recipient" option for details).
  



================================================================================
=== CHANGED OPTIONS
================================================================================
The following spamdyke options have changed their behavior/effect:
  "help" now displays only a list of all the available options.  To see the full
    listing of all options with descriptions, use "more-help".
  "qmail-rcpthosts-file" (formerly "local-domains-file") now has the default
    value "/var/qmail/control/rcpthosts".

The following spamdyke options have only been renamed (behavior/effect remains
unchanged):
  local-domains-file became qmail-rcpthosts-file
  rejection-text-missing-sender-mx became rejection-text-sender-no-mx
  rejection-text-identical-sender-recipient became
    rejection-text-recipient-same-as-sender



================================================================================
=== REMOVED OPTIONS
================================================================================
The following spamdyke options have been removed:
  access-file
  local-domains-entry
  reject-identical-sender-recipient
  reject-missing-sender-mx
  rejection-text-access-denied
